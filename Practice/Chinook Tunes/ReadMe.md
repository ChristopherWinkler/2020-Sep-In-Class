## Customer's Song Listings

Given the concepts in the following mockup, we want to create a web page that shows the customer's songs listed in various ways.

![Mockup](./SongListings.png)

We would have to build queries for the various views of the songs. Create LINQ queries in LinqPad for the following:

- Info to populate the Drop-Down to select the customer
- Info on the number of songs/albums/artists for the customer's purchased tracks
- Details on the songs listed depending on the display formatting:
  - All Songs
  - By Album
  - By Artist
